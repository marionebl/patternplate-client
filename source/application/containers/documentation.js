Currently there is no readme data at \`./patterns/readme.md\`, so we left this
friendly reminder here to change that soon.

You could start right away:

\`\`\`sh
echo "# Docs\\n This patternplate contains ..." > patterns/readme.md
\`\`\`

Some ideas on what to write into your pattern readme

*  Why this Living Styleguide interface exists, e.g. what problems it should solve
*  What the components in are intended for, e.g. a brand, website or product
*  The component hierarchy you use, e.g. Atomic Design
*  Naming conventions
*  Rules for dependencies
*  Browser matrix
